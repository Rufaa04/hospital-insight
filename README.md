# These were the questions that needed to be answerd
1.1. Open the dataset Kenyan_Hospital_Health_Records.xlsx and explore its structure. 
How many columns and rows does the dataset have? 
1.2. For each patient, create an Email Address column by combining the First Name and 
Last Name columns and convert to lower case using the same formula 
2.1. Bold the header row, adjust the column widths. 
2.2. Apply conditional formatting to the Payment Status column, so that: 
 "Paid" is highlighted in green. 
 "Pending" is highlighted in yellow. 
 "Partially Paid" is highlighted in red. 2.3. Add borders to the entire dataset. 
3.1. Create a new column called Patient Age Group and categorize patients as follows: 
 Child: Age ≤ 12 
 Teenager: Age > 12 and ≤ 19 
 Adult: Age > 19 and ≤ 60 
 Senior: Age > 60 
3.2. Create another column called Age Difference and calculate the difference in age 
between each patient and the oldest patient in the dataset. 
4.1. Using the COUNTIF and IF functions, find and highlight the oldest patient with 
Hypertension in the dataset. (The patient must have "Hypertension" in the Diagnosis 
column.) 
4.3. Using SUMIF, calculate the total Bill Amount (KES) for each Hospital Department 
(e.g., General Medicine, Cardiology, etc.). 
4.4. Calculate the average bill amount for all patients who are "Adults" (using the Age 
Group column). 
5.1. Filter the data to show only the patients who: 
 Have a Diagnosis of either "Malaria" or "Typhoid". 
 Have a "Paid" Payment Status. 
 Were diagnosed by doctors in the General Medicine department. 
5.2. Filter to show only patients whose Bill Amount (KES) is greater than 10,000 and who 
have "Partially Paid" status. 
6.1. Using INDEX, MATCH, and IF functions, identify who is the oldest patient diagnosed 
with "Hypertension" in the dataset. 
6.2. Create a table showing the total number of patients per department (e.g., Cardiology, 
Pediatrics, General Medicine). 
6.3. Find the average age of patients who are diagnosed with "Asthma" and have a 
"Pending" payment status. 
7.1. Use Conditional Formatting to highlight: 
 All patients with a Bill Amount (KES) greater than 20,000 in red. 
 All patients diagnosed with "Diabetes" in blue. 
8.1. Add a "Feedback Received" column with a drop-down list allowing the values "Yes", 
"No", and "Not Applicable". 8.2. Set Data Validation for the Age column to allow only 
whole numbers between 1 and 120. 
9.1. Convert your dataset into an Excel Table and name the table PatientRecords. 
9.2. Add a Total Row at the bottom of the table that calculates: 
 Total Bill Amount (KES). 
 Count of Patients. 9.3. Add a Slicer for the Diagnosis column and enable it to filter 
the table by different diagnoses (e.g., Typhoid, Malaria, etc.).
